            <strong>Krohnen</strong> is a very loud person with an extremely short temper, though he has matured somewhat since adopting his new identity (as Ángel pointed out his team's ending), claiming to be a changed person. An example of his maturity is shown during his ending with Ángel and Kula where he returns the latter to Foxy and Diana unharmed, and even giving Kula the prize money they earned from the tournament (which he planned to use for his and Ángel's own purposes).

            He hates Kyo Kusanagi and K' with passion and intensity. Though he has no personal grudge towards the original Kyo himself, he only fought him because Kyo's facial appearance during the fifteenth tournament(including his classic hairstyle and headband) reminded him of a Kyo-look alike fighter whom Krohnen held a grudge against. Towards those remotely showing kindness to him and his partner Ángel, he can be somewhat considerate, as he showed with Ramon.
